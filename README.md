## Hi there, I'm Andy

I'm an analyst and linguist by trade. Although I've dabbled with programming in the past, I only started focusing heavily on web development in Jan 2020, with the aim of changing careers in the next few years. I fell in love with front-end development almost immediately, and I've particularly enjoyed learning Svelte as it acted as an excellent transition point from VanillaJS.

### I’m currently working on

1. A svelte weather app, which uses OpenWeatherMap, LocationIQ, Charts.js, IndexedDB and lambda functions. It was meant as an initial future portfolio project (once it's more refined), that would help consolidate everything I had learned upto this point and I wanted it to be something that challenged me.

2. ISBN Barcode scanner application that retrieves information about book from an API and stores it in a FaunaDB database and acts like a digital book collection/library.

### I’m currently learning

1. More about state management and ways to impliment immer's produce function alongside Svelte writable stores.
2. FaunaDB. I've enjoyed working within the JAMstack so far and I felt this was a good choice to get to grips with.
3. How to impliment a refresh token (HTTPOnly cookie) and access token (in memory) flow, with a partial backend (Netlify Functions), for authorisation.
4. More about testing in general - Jest, Mocha, Web Test Runner.

### I'm currently using

1. JS / Svelte
2. Node.js / AWS Lambda
3. Snowpack / Rollup / Git
