2. Automated irrigation system

### I’m currently learning

1. More about state management and ways to impliment immer's produce function alongside Svelte writable stores.
2. FaunaDB.
3. How to impliment a refresh token (HTTPOnly cookie) and access token (in memory) flow, with a partial backend (Netlify Functions), for authorisation.
4. More about testing in general - Jest, Mocha, Web Test Runner.
5. Electronics relevant to makers.
6. C programming language.
7. pico-sdk.

### I'm currently using

1. JS / Svelte
2. C / pico-sdk
3. Node.js / AWS Lambda
4. Snowpack / Rollup / Git
