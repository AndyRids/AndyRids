## Hi there, I'm Andy

I'm an analyst and linguist by trade. I only started focusing heavily on web development in Jan 2020. I fell in love with front-end development, and I've particularly enjoyed learning Svelte as it acted as an excellent transition point from VanillaJS. I've also been developing with the Raspberry Pi products and in particular, the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. I find embedded software development and IoT in general very interesting.

### I’m currently working on

1. NRF24L01 driver for Raspberry Pi Pico

2. Automated irrigation system

### I’m currently learning

1. More about state management and ways to impliment immer's produce function alongside Svelte writable stores.
2. FaunaDB. I've enjoyed working within the JAMstack so far and I felt this was a good choice to get to grips with.
3. How to impliment a refresh token (HTTPOnly cookie) and access token (in memory) flow, with a partial backend (Netlify Functions), for authorisation.
4. More about testing in general - Jest, Mocha, Web Test Runner.
5. Electronics relevant to makers.
6. C programming language.
7. pico-sdk.

### I'm currently using

1. JS / Svelte
2. C / pico-sdk
3. Node.js / AWS Lambda
4. Snowpack / Rollup / Git
